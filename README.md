# Excel-Vrinda_store_dashboard

📍 Goal
The main aim of the "Vrinda Store Annual Report 2022" was to delve deep into customer behavior and sales performance to chart a path for growth in 2023.

🔢 Steps Taken:
🔍 Data Extraction - I gathered the data in an Excel (.XLSX) format.
🖌 Data Cleaning - This crucial step ensured the reliability and accuracy of the raw data by fixing inconsistent values and handling NULL entries.
🔢 Data Processing - To gain deeper insights, I added two new columns, 'Age Group' and 'Month,' to the dataset.
📊 Data Analysis - I leveraged Pivot Tables to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in the data.
📊 Data Visualization - I transformed these insights into engaging charts, graphs, and slicers to make the data more accessible.

👉 Key Findings:
📌 The highest sales were recorded in March.
📌 Women accounted for the majority of purchases (64%).
📌 The age group of 30-49 made the most significant contribution to sales.
📌 The top-performing states were Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.
📌 A whopping 92% of orders were successfully delivered.
📌 Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart emerged as the leading contributors.

✅ Conclusion:
To drive growth, the strategy should focus on targeting women in the 30-49 age group residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. Utilize ad campaigns, coupons, and exclusive offers available on Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart to capture their attention.

I want to express my gratitude to Rishabh Mishra for his invaluable guidance throughout this project.
